# ReproDANs
You need to download MNIST, CIFAR10 and Caltech256 for these files.
The good news is pytorch datasets have integrated the first two; the bad news is the last one isn't.

They are the reproducibility test for the being-reviewed paper "Incrimental Learning Through Deep Adaptation Neural Network",
as a project for COMP 652 Machine Learning.

[This is another fancy reproduction, check it out!](https://github.com/jianingsun21/cnn_incremental-learning)\
[Code written by the author of "Incrimental Learning Through DAN" can be found here](https://github.com/rosenfeldamir/incremental_learning)

As of currently, we have evaluated three models.
